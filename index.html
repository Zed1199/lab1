<p>My name is Zinedine D. Sabroso and this is my website. </p>
<p>People call me Zed for short because some of the person that I know sometime find my name hard to pronounce so I decided to shorten it for good. Some people may find me shy and very 
quiet but that is only when I first met you, and when I started to know you I may be able to show some interesting side of me which is a joyful person who just wanted to have a good time.</p>

<p class="Promo">My Stories</p>
<p>		Me personally I never travel a lot when I was young, I only travel when my nieces and cousins invited us for a road trips toward different kind of location such as Tagaytay, Vigan, Baguio, Manaoag, and Cebu. Most of the trip was fun and I’m able to have a great
 memory and develop myself even more. The unexpected journey that I have is when I look at the very dark night and see a thousand of stars on the sky, I picture that image deep on my memory so that I can never forget about it ever again.</p>

<p>		What I find surprising about myself is that how I complete my freshmen years, I just go to school complete my task and go home or if the professors just gave us a homework I will pass it on time just to avoid any kind of rush to the season or even presenting a project on the finals, but I guess time
 flow faster if you have things to do and someone giving you pointers, but I’m glad I finish my freshmen year and saying hello to my sophomores year and I hope my all things go well.</p>

<p>		Now I spent my summer on swimming and mostly sitting in front of my computer playing video game most of it is grinding games where I gather a lot of material just to beat a specific enemy and that’s about it, 
and watching movies that I miss while going to school most of the movie that I watch is action and drama and it help me get more idea of writing and speaking different kinds of language because of history channels.</p>

<p>Today I’m feeling quite frail, because there is something that I forgot but not 
seem to remember of what it is, its like I’m being haunted by my past but when I feel that I always counter it with happy thoughts and able to release it with everyone just to let them know that I’m fine and nothing to worry about, but who cares about its on the past and today is the present so I will focus here instead.</p>
